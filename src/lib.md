Adds the following fallible methods to iterators:

* `try_all`
* `try_any`
* `try_position`
* `try_rposition`

## Motivation

This crate was born out of the necessity of a fallible version for the [`Iterator::position`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.position) method. A [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/78218651/6923555) was asked, but, contrary to the analog [`try_for_each`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.try_for_each), the solution was rather cumbersome. This resulted in [this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/issues/361) in the Rust repository, and finally this crate.

Until the standard library adds these methods – if ever –, they are available in this crate.

## Usage

Add the dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
try-iterator = { version = "0.0.1" }
```

Then import the `prelude` at the top of your source files:

```rust
use try_iterator::prelude::*;
```

The new methods will be automatically present in [`Iterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html).
